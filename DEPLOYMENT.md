# 🚀 Deployment Guide

## ✅ Project Status: Ready for GitHub Pages

Your ISO Quality Education Survey application is now fully configured and ready to deploy to GitHub Pages!

## 📦 What Was Done

### ✨ Files Cleaned Up
- ✅ Removed `database_setup.sql` (not needed for static site)
- ✅ Removed `submit_survey.php` (GitHub Pages doesn't support PHP)
- ✅ Removed duplicate files (`Index1.html`, old HTML folder)
- ✅ Removed unused CSS/JS files (`css/`, `js/` folders)
- ✅ Removed old configuration files
- ✅ Removed Laravel view files

### 🔧 Files Updated
- ✅ `survey.js` - Now saves to localStorage instead of PHP backend
- ✅ `dashboard.js` - Reads from localStorage for analytics
- ✅ `index.html` - Updated to redirect to `home.html`
- ✅ All navigation links updated to use `home.html`

### 📄 New Files Created
- ✅ `home.html` - New main landing page with proper navigation
- ✅ Updated `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Quick Deploy (Recommended)

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# 1. Commit the cleanup changes
git commit -m "Clean up project for GitHub Pages deployment"

# 2. Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

That's it! Your site will automatically deploy via GitHub Actions.

### Option 2: Manual GitHub Pages Setup

If automatic deployment doesn't work:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** → **Pages**
3. Under "Source", select **main** branch
4. Select **/ (root)** folder
5. Click **Save**
6. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment

## 🔍 Verify Deployment

After pushing, you can:

1. **Check GitHub Actions**
   - Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
   - You should see a "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow running
   - Wait for it to complete (usually 1-2 minutes)

2. **Access Your Site**
   - Your site will be at: `https://[your-username].github.io/ISO-Frontend/`
   - Or check the deployment URL in the Actions workflow output

## 📱 User Flow

```
1. Landing: index.html (Splash Screen)
   ↓
2. Home: home.html (Main Navigation)
   ↓
   ├─→ Survey: survey.html → thank-you.html
   │   
   └─→ Dashboard: dashboard.html
```

## 💾 How Data Works

Since this is a static site (no backend), data is stored in the browser's localStorage:

- **Survey responses** → Saved to `surveyResponses` in localStorage
- **Progress tracking** → Saved to `surveyProgress` in localStorage
- **Dashboard data** → Read from `surveyResponses` or uses mock data

### View Stored Data

Open browser console (F12) and run:
```javascript
// View all responses
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('surveyResponses'))

// Clear all data
localStorage.clear()
```

## 🎨 Customization

### Update Colors
Edit `styles.css`:
- Primary Purple: `#312e81`
- Secondary Blue: `#4338ca`
- Accent Gold: `#fde047`

### Update Survey Questions
Edit `survey.js` → `surveySections` array

### Update Dashboard
Edit `dashboard.js` → Chart creation functions

## 🔧 Testing Locally

Before deploying, test locally:

```bash
# Option 1: Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Option 2: Node.js
npx http-server

# Then open: http://localhost:8000
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **All data is client-side** - Stored in browser localStorage
2. **No server required** - Pure HTML/CSS/JS
3. **Mobile responsive** - Works on all devices
4. **Offline capable** - Survey progress is saved automatically

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### Survey
- ✅ 8 sections with progress tracking
- ✅ Auto-save after each answer
- ✅ Can navigate back/forward
- ✅ Validates required fields
- ✅ Saves to localStorage on submit

### Dashboard
- ✅ Shows mock data by default
- ✅ Uses real data if surveys submitted
- ✅ Interactive charts with tooltips
- ✅ Filters by year/grade
- ✅ Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Site Not Loading
- Check if `index.html` exists in root
- Verify GitHub Pages is enabled
- Wait 2-3 minutes after push

### Data Not Saving
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure localStorage is enabled
- Try incognito/private mode

### Charts Not Showing
- Check browser console
- Ensure `dashboard.js` is loaded
- Verify localStorage has data
